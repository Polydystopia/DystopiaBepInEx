## General

This mod’s sole purpose is to redirect the game to a custom backend.  
On first launch, it will generate a file named `polydystopia_server_config.json` in your game’s root directory.  
Simply open that JSON file and update it to point at a custom server.

## Installation

1. **Prerequisite**: You must have [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) installed and working.  
2. Download this mod’s dll file.  
3. Copy the ZIP into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder in your game’s root directory.  
4. Launch the game. BepInEx will detect and load your new plugin automatically.
5. Edit `polydystopia_server_config.json` and launch the game again.
